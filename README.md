This code is an implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in C++. It allows two players to play the game on the console. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The code begins by including the necessary header files, such as `<iostream>` for input/output operations, `<string>` for string handling, `<windows.h>` for console manipulation, `<conio.h>` for getch() function, and `<stdlib.h>` for system() function.

2. The global variable `space` is a 2-dimensional array that represents the Tic Tac Toe board.

3. The global variables `row` and `column` are used to store the user's input for the position they want to mark on the board.

4. The variable `token` represents the current player's token, which is either 'x' or 'o'. It is initially set to 'x'.

5. The boolean variable `tie` is used to determine if the game ends in a tie.

6. The functions `menu()`, `game()`, and `endgame()` are defined.

   - The `menu()` function displays the current state of the board.
   
   - The `game()` function handles the gameplay logic. It prompts the current player to enter a position on the board, validates the input, updates the board, and switches the current player's token.
   
   - The `endgame()` function checks for winning conditions or a tie. It returns `true` if there is a winner, `false` otherwise.
   
7. In the `main()` function:
   
   - The `system("Color 1F")` command sets the console color to bright white on blue.
   
   - The initial instructions and introduction of players are displayed.
   
   - The game loop continues until there is a winner or a tie. In each iteration, the `menu()` function is called to display the board, followed by the `game()` function to handle player input and update the board. Finally, the `endgame()` function is called to check if the game should end.
   
   - After the game loop ends, the winner (if any) or a tie is displayed.
